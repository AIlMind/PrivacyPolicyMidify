### Privacy Policy

#### Last Updated: August 29, 2024

Thank you for using our app. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using our app, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the app.

### 1. Information We Collect

#### 1.1 Feedback Collection
- **Google Form Feedback**: We collect feedback through an embedded Google Form within the app. Providing your email address is optional. The feedback you provide, including any optional email address, is stored on our Google Drive.
- **Opt-In Basis**: Submitting feedback is completely voluntary, and you may choose not to provide any personal information.

#### 1.2 Future Data Collection
- **Cloud Saving of MIDI Files**: In the future, we may offer a feature to save MIDI files on a cloud server. If you choose to use this feature, your MIDI files and related prompts will be stored on our cloud servers, initially on Netlify or Vercel, with potential migration to AWS, GCP, Azure, or a combination thereof. We will provide these cloud providers with the minimum information necessary to perform their services.
- **Prompt and Chat History**: If you opt-in to save your prompt/chat history along with your MIDI files, this information will also be stored on our cloud servers and used solely by the owners of Midify to improve the service offering. In some circumstances, we may retain prompt data for up to 30 days, even if you opt out of saving, for legal reasons and fraud prevention; however, this data will not be used in any other way.
- **Technical Information**: When you interact with our app, we may automatically collect technical information, such as your device type, operating system, IP address, and usage data (e.g., features used, time spent in the app). This data is used to improve the functionality and security of our services.
- **LLM API Services**: User prompts may be processed through third-party LLM API services, including OpenAI, Gemini API, and Claude API. We will provide these services with the minimum information necessary to perform their duties.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

- **Service Improvement**: The data collected is used to improve and develop new features for our app, enhance user experience, and conduct research to better understand user needs.
- **Feedback**: The feedback you provide via the Google Form helps us improve our app and services. If you provide your email address, it may be used to follow up on your feedback or provide support.
- **Cloud Services**: Your MIDI files, prompts, and chat history, if opted in, will be used to enable the cloud-saving features of the app.
- **Communication**: If you provide contact information, we may use it to send you updates, marketing communications, or information about events related to our services. You can opt out of these communications at any time.
- **Security and Fraud Prevention**: Personal data may be used to prevent fraud, criminal activity, or misuse of our services, and to protect the security of our systems and users.
- **Third-Party LLM Services**: Your prompts may be processed by third-party LLM services to provide the functionality of the app, with the minimum required information shared for these services to perform their functions.
